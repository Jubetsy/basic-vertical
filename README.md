## Documentation for Business Card

I had originally hoped to animate my logo on the card but wasn't able to get it to work. Even though this didn't work put, I still really love how my business card turned out. I used HTML for my text and CSS to incorporate the colors and the image. I linked my real instagram and website in the html and then played around with pixels and moving things around until they were placed where I wanted them.
