## Documentation for Business Card

I had originally hoped to animate my logo on the card but wasn't able to get it to work. Even though this didn't work put, I still really love how my business card turned out. I used HTML for my text and incorporating my graphics but CSS was the main player for the design of my business card site. I used @keyframes to animate the 5 bubble graphics on my site, making them rotate around a fixed point in order to give off the impression that they were floating, as well as for the particles I have slowly moving on the screen. These two uses of @keyframes in a way helped me achieve the effect I wanted to go with in my original 3D design for my site.
